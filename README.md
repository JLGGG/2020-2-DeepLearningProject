+ ClassificationCNN : Image classification model using dataset CIFAR10(variable-size image support).   
+ OriginalCifar10UsingTransferLearning : Bring pre-trained model and transfer learning test.    
+ Randomization : Implementing a randomization preprocess layer designed to mitigate adversarial effects.   
+ GaussianNoiseCifar10 : Example of creating adversarial examples using a Gaussian distribution.   
+ FGSM : Implementing the content of the "Explaining and Harnessing Adversarial Examples" paper published by Google in 2015.
